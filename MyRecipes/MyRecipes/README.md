# RED VELVEL CAKE 

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and prep your cake pans by lining them with circles of parchment paper in the bottoms, then spray bottoms and sides with cooking spray.

Whisk all the dry ingredients together first – flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt (and soup also if you dislike salt, reduce the salt also) – and set them aside.

Beat butter and sugar together until light and creamy – about 3-4 minutes using a hand mixer or stand mixer. Then add the oil and beat again, scraping down the sides of the bowl.
 The mixture will look a little curdled, but there’s nothing to worry about.

Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating between each addition, and vanilla.
 Then mix in the vinegar and food coloring (affiliate link).
Alternately add 1/3 of the dry ingredients with 1/3 of the buttermilk, mixing just until combined after each addition and scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl, repeating until everything has been added.

Pour the batter evenly between the two cake pans, then bake for 30-35 minutes (for 9-inch pans) or 38-43 minutes (for 8-inch pans), or until a cake tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean with just a few crumbs. Be sure not to overbake.

Cool completely before frosting with cream cheese frosting.
